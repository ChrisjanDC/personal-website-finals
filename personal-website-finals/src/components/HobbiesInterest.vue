    <p>
      In my free time, I enjoy exploring creative and technical activities that inspire me.
      Whether itâ€™s coding new projects, designing layouts, playing games, or learning something new,
      I always look for ways to grow and express myself. I also love spending time outdoors,
      taking photos, and connecting with people who share the same passions.

      When I'm not inside the court, I usually play online games with my friends,
      watch some movies, as well as walk my dog at the park.
